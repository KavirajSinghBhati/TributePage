        Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
        alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant
        electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
        "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in
        modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly
        worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
        patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George
        Westinghouse.
